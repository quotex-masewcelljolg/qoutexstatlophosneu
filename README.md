## About the PyQuotex Library

This library was developed with the purpose of facilitating
communication with the Quotex platform through WebSockets, enabling
real-time data retrieval and the automation of operations. **It is
important to note that this library is not a trading bot, nor does it
intend to be**.

### Library Objective

The main goal of this library is to provide the necessary tools for
developers to integrate their applications with the Quotex platform,
automating specific operations in a safe and efficient manner.

### Automation Implementation

Any additional automation, including the creation of automatic bots that
make trading decisions, must be implemented by the developer who chooses
to use this library in their projects. The responsibility for these
additional implementations lies entirely with the developer.

### Disclaimer

As the developer of this library, **I am not responsible for any
malfunction or application failure** that may occur due to improper use
of the library or the implementation of automations that go beyond the
original scope of this tool.

If you decide to use this library, it is crucial that you carefully
analyze and rigorously test your implementations to ensure that they
meet your needs and expectations.

## Notice about Support and Discussions

Due to the high volume of messages seeking information and support, and
considering that I am just one person and do not have the time to assist
everyone individually, **I have created a [discussion group on
Telegram](\%22https://t.me/+Uzcmc-NZvN4xNTQx\%22){target=""_blank""}**.

This group was created so that members can help each other, ask
questions, and collaborate with others who are also using this library.
Your participation and interaction in the group are highly encouraged,
as this way everyone can benefit from the collective experience.

Feel free to join the group and contribute with your questions and
knowledge.

## Important Note

For some reason, cloudflare ends up identifying automated access to the
quotex API and we applies a block, which prevents successful
authentication on the platform using a user and password, I recommend
using Python 3.8 or higher to be successful with this API. For Windows
users it is necessary to install the latest possible openssl, which can
be obtained
[here](\%22https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html\%22){target=""_blank""}.
For Linux users, the latest possible versions of openssl are also
recommended, simply just run \`sudo apt install openssl\`.

Let\'s Go to the Private Repository
